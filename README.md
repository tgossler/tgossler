👋 Hi, I’m Thomas Goßler (@thgossler).<br/>
👀 I’m interested in .NET and web platform enterprise software as a service development on Microsoft Azure for healthcare. Open Source software is contributing a lot today in this domain, and I'm looking for ways to contribute.<br/>
🌱 I’m currently learning what it means to publish and maintain an open source project.<br/>
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on relevant projects and improve them for use in enterprise scenarios.<br/>
