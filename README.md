👋 Hi, I’m Thomas Goßler (@thgossler).
👀 I’m interested in .NET 5+ and web platform enterprise software as a service development on Microsoft Azure for healthcare. Open Source software is contributing a lot today in this domain, and I'm looking for ways to contribute.
🌱 I’m currently learning what it means to publish and maintain an open source project.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on relevant projects and improve them for use in enterprise scenarios.
📫 You can reach me for example on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/thgossler).
