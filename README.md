👋 Hi, I’m Thomas Gossler ([@thgossler](https://twitter.com/thgossler)).<br/>
👀 I’m interested in .NET, web platform and enterprise SaaS development on Azure in the healthcare domain.<br/>
:bulb: We are benefiting a lot from Open Source software today, and I'm looking for ways to contribute back.<br/>
🌱 I’m currently learning what it means to publish and maintain open source projects.<br/>
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on relevant projects and improve them for use in enterprise scenarios.<br/>
